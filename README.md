# Life Helper SolidJS Application

## Basics

1. To start this application run the following command.
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
1. This application uses the `Express Server` application as the backend. It assumes it is listening on port 3001.
1. Note that it is important that this application starts on port 3000 as the server overrides `CORS` for requests coming from this port.
